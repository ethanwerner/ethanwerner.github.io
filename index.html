    <h1>Ochre</h1>
    <p>
      Recently, one of the topics that I have held great interest in is
      <strong>ochre</strong>. Found across the world, ochres are naturally
      occurring <strong>iron oxide</strong> pigments which take on varying
      yellow and red colors. These pigments, are collected, crushed, and sieved
      in order to be used in painting. Since I have friends and family who are
      professional artists, I recently took a hiking trip to the Eastern Hills
      of <strong>Oakland</strong> where I was able to collect samples.
